<h1> Burning Man: a community of creators and destroyers centered around the idea of "Radical Inclusion" </h1>

<div id="intro">

  Burning Man, a countercultural phenomenon that occurs each year in the middle of the desert, is guided by 10 core principles, including radical inclusion, decommodification, immediacy, participation and leaving no trace. Tens of thousands of “burners” live together for about a week, participating in activities, contributing art, and at the end watching a giant wooden figure, or “The Man” burn to the ground. “The Burning Man is Disneyland in reverse . . . Woodstock turned inside out,” co-founder Larry Harvey told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1996. “It is anything you want it to be.”

    It all began in 1986 on Baker Beach near San Francisco, when Harvey and Jerry James set fire to an eight-foot-tall wooden model of a man with approximately 20 bystanders.
    The growing festival moved from the beach to the desert in 1990. Now, nearly 70,000 people gather for Burning Man each year, inhabitants of a city that pops up and disappears in a matter of weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    But while they’re there amid the sands, both “virgin” and long-time burners spend the week each year in late August constructing giant art sculptures and biking around the playa and participating in camps that offer a variety of experiences.
    The annual Black Rock Census collects extensive demographic and experience information from burners each year.

    What census data tells us about who participates
  </p>
</div>

<div id="body">
  <p>
    Each year, volunteers help collect and analyze survey results from the festival-goers to produce the Black Rock City Census. Data is collected in two phases: one is a survey that is passed out at random to attendees entering Black Rock City,
    and two is an online survey that goes out after the festival to all attendees. In 2017, more than 9,000 burners completed the online survey.
  </p>

  <p>
    The census has been conducted consistently since 2005, and in 2012 the team introduced a new system to ensure that results could be comparable from year to year. In 2017, as with previous years, the majority of burners were white/caucasian, and since 2013 there has been a slight increase in the number of Hispanics/Latinos and Asians attending Burning Man. Only 1 percent of burners were black. The reason racial diversity is low at Burning Man has been a topic of much discussion in recent years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nearly 80 percent of attendees were from the United States (most notably from California) in 2017, and nearly 50 percent of burners were ages 25 to 34.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recent years there has been increased discussion over extravagant spending in preparation for Burning Man by tech elite and celebrities, as well events held by prominent entrepreneurs that attempt to mirror the aesthetic of Burning Man.
    In 2017, over 75 percent of burners spent more than $1,000 dollars to attend (excluding ticket cost), and more than 50 percent of attendees had a household income below $100,000.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, each year a number of celebrities also attended Burning Man. Kathy Baird, who this year will be participating in her eighth Burning Man, said their presence doesn’t diminish the overall spirit and experience on the playa.
  </p>
  <blockquote id="quote">
    “My hope is that regardless of who you are and where you come from, that you could come to an experience like Burning Man … and walk away and be a better human being as a result of your time there,”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    she said. “Whether you’re Paris Hilton or whether you’re Joe-Schmo from Indiana — I think the idea that the culture of Burning Man transcends your status in society is true,” Baird said.

    "Burning Man isn't just an event. It's a community, it's a city. And when I was first getting involved back in 2001, it wasn’t just to go and party. I was very interested in costume culture. 
    It was a passionate thing, and I was going around to a lot of arts events and costume parties taking pictures of people in costume."

  <p>
    "In 2001, I went on my own [to Burning Man], didn't know anybody and fell into a whole new world that has changed my life."
