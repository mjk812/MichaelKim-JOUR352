    <strong>Student Journalist and Government and Politics Major</strong>
      <p>My name is Michael Kim and I am a student at the University of Maryland - College Park currently majoring in Journalism and Government and Politics.
          As a student photojournalist, I hope that my media, wheter it be videos or photos, help bring stories to life for the public. With digital media and internet content becoming increasingly popular,
          I am excited to see what it has in store for the field of journalism. Ever since I was young, photos, as well as videos, have entertained and excited me. It is my hope that someday my content will provide people with those same feelings. </p>
