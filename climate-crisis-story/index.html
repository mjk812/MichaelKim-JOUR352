<!-- Introduction -->

    <p>
      Heat radiates from the asphalt and concrete that cover the streets, the sidewalks, the alleys, even the tiny yards behind the homes in the East Baltimore neighborhood of McElderry Park.
      Trees are scarce. And air doesn’t move much when it comes up against block after block of rowhouses.
    </p>

    <p>
      So as a dangerous 11-day heat wave tormented the city in July, the hottest month ever recorded on the planet, fewer and fewer residents were going outside.

    <p>
      But it is going to get worse. In McElderry Park and around the world, in communities rich and poor, downtown and in the suburbs, weather disasters loom.
      And experts are using language ever more dire.
    </p>

    <p>
      “The single greatest threat from climate change to people in cities is extreme heat,” said Jad Daley, president and CEO of American Forests, a nonprofit organization
      dedicated to preserving forests and planting trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      In July, Anchorage, Alaska, recorded 90 degrees for the first time. Europe suffered through record temperatures, with Paris hitting 109. The heat moved across Scandinavia
      and into Greenland, where scientists said it speeded the melting of Arctic ice that would increase flooding in coastal cities — including Baltimore.
    </p>

    <p>
    Average annual temperatures in Baltimore have gone up more than 3 degrees over the last century, nearly twice as much as the rest of the country.
    And the planet’s warming has gained momentum, say researchers who estimate the number of very hot days in Baltimore could increase six-fold by the middle of the century.
    </p>

    <p>
      More and more people, including Del . Robbyn Lewis, who represents parts of East Baltimore, are replacing the words “climate change” with stronger language.
    </p>

<!-- Urban Heat Issues -->

    <p class="header">
      Urban Heat Issues
    </p>

    <p>
      Cities, crowded and paved over, already feel the impact of climate change, with poorer air quality and streets, highways and bridges damaged by storms. But certain neighborhoods
      will continue to feel the effects of extreme temperatures more than others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Researchers at Portland State University in Oregon and the Science Museum of Virginia have mapped these areas, called urban heat islands, and data shows that temperatures here and
      in surrounding neighborhoods can run 8 degrees hotter than in communities that have more trees and less pavement.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      McElderry Park, which despite its lyrical name offers little green space, is one of these: the hottest neighborhood in Baltimore, a city whose climate has long been classified as humid subtropical
    </p>

    <p>
      Residents in the hottest areas have higher rates of chronic illnesses affected by heat, including asthma and COPD. In hot weather, emergency medical calls for some chronic conditions increase. The rate of emergency medical calls for cardiac arrest and congestive heart failure, for example, nearly double when the heat index hits 103 degrees.
    </p>

    <p>
      "When we talk about the environment,” Lewis said, “we’re talking about human health.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The city’s hottest areas are poorer, which means the residents don’t have the resources to move out.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is true across the United States. In a majority of the country's most populous cities, people with lower incomes typically lived in the hottest areas, an investigation by journalists from NPR and the University of Maryland found.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      In short, as the planet warms, the urban poor in dozens of large U.S. cities will actually experience more heat than the wealthy, simply by virtue of where they live.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sacoby Wilson, who studies applied environmental health as an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, said people in low-income neighborhoods walk more, ride more buses and drive fewer cars — so they contribute less to climate change. And yet they are more vulnerable to dying in extreme heat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The streets have fewer trees than those in more affluent communities. Rowhouses, Baltimore’s signature architecture, trap heat and stay hot even when the heat eases on summer nights. The houses are old, often poorly insulated and hard to maintain. Crime rates are higher, so many people won’t put an air-conditioning unit in a first-floor window for fear of break-ins.
